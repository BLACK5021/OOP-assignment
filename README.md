# Python OOP Assignments - Superhero & Vehicles

This repository contains Python assignments for exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Superhero Class
- Create a custom `Superhero` class with attributes and methods
- Demonstrates:
  - Constructors
  - Encapsulation (private attributes)
  - Inheritance (via `FlyingSuperhero`)

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism with Vehicles
- Base class `Vehicle`
- Subclasses: `Car`, `Plane`, `Boat` — each overrides the `move()` method

## 💻 How to Run
Run each file with:
```bash
python superhero.py
python vehicles.py
